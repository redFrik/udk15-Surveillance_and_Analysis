Olofsson: Audiovisual Programming - Surveillance and Analysis

This semester's focus is on monitoring, tracking and detection systems and the analysis of data. We will experiment with different types of sensors, microphones and cameras as well as network data - all in order to learn how to extract information from our behavior and our environment. The software used will be a mixture of programs like [Python](https://www.python.org), [Processing](http://processing.org) and [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) together with libraries like [NLTK](http://nltk.org), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) and [SCMIR](http://composerprogrammer.com/research/scmir.pdf). We will play with automatic speech and text analysis, try out video surveillance and eavesdropping, set up face and gesture recognition systems, learn about music information retrieval techniques and also on a lower hardware level work with vibration, gps, light and temperature sensors to monitor ourselves and the surroundings. In the end we will have a better understanding of these techniques and therefore better evaluate their uses, risks and dangers. The course is intermediate level and will be taught in English.
