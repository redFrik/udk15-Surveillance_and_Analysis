* make sure you download the code in this github directory (easiest if you go up one level and click 'clone or download' and then 'download zip')
* now open and start the processing sketch `networks_scanner.pde` (if problem make sure you have the OscP5 library installed)
* open terminal and cd to the folder udk160609. e.g. `cd ~/Downloads/udk15-Surveillance_and_Analysis/udk160609`
* then type `python networks_scanner_osx.py` (or `sudo python networks_scanner_linux.py` if you are running linux)
* if you have problems make sure you have the pyosc python package installed (see last week)
* if it works you should see white text in processing
